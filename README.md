# Learning Log


## Trying a thing
I want to capture what I'm learning in my projects and track resources used. Recently used the structure: `approach(es)`, `objective(s)`, `blocker(s)`, `outcome(s)` for a work project, and it went very well. I was able to see where I got stuck and how I got myself unstuck and how long that took me.
- `approach(es)`: overview of what I was doing. ex. planning, coding, researching.
- `objective(s)`: what I plannned to get done. re: to-do list
- `blocker(s)`: what go me stuck today, what help did I need
- `outcome(s)` what actually happened, optionally: how did I clear a current or previous blocker

## Challenge, Action, Result
During a workshop for storytelling, I came across the CAR method. I might switch it up and use these prompts as well. Especially to talk about details to clear blockers.

## Structure
This will likely change, but just so I can have a template to copy:
